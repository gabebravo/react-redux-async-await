#### This project utilizes a public api for finding recipes, but it uses Redux-Thunk + axios and ES7 async/await patterns to set the data in the redux reducer and update the UI.

#### Additionally, it uses the reactstrap library for the UI components. Reactstrap is now using Bootstrap4, which allows for use of custom flexbox classes. So all the styling was done using flexbox features in bootstrap4.
